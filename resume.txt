EATON CORPORATION
Eden Prairie, MN
http://www.eaton.com/
Lead Embedded Software Engineer
10/2007 to Present

Leading the development of the embedded vehicle control
software for Eaton's Hydraulic Launch Assist (HLA) program: a
hydraulic hybrid system for heavy duty trucks.  Involved in all
aspects of software development from requirements definition,
coding, verification, and vehicle testing.  Coordinated both
on-shore and off-shore development teams.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Developed Atom, a domain specific language and compiler used
  extensively on HLA (http://www.tomahawkins.org/). Atom
  provides lock-free, concurrent programming, with deterministic
  time and memory performance for hard real-time applications.

* Ported HLA prototyping software from Simulink to Atom and C,
  reducing the lines of source code from 120K to 4K.  Refined
  the design from early system prototyping to production.

* Built an automated test framework for HLA software that
  provided constrained random test stimulus, parametric test
  generation, functional coverage, and assertion checking.
  Integrated the framework with a requirements database for
  test traceability.

* Developed a tool for formal verification of C programs based
  on infinite state model checking and k-induction.  Presented
  the tool and an overview of formal verification to Eaton's
  Aerospace group.

* Built an instruction set simulator (ISS) to analyze execution
  of embedded PowerPC programs.  Used the simulator to analyze
  an embedded bootloader.

* Invented a new hydraulic piston pump with theoretical
  efficiency improvements over conventional axial piston pumps.
  Created Mecha, a solid modeling language, which was used to
  illustrate the pump's kinematics.


MEDTRONIC, INC.
Fridley, MN
http://www.medtronic.com/
Senior Design Automation Engineer
1/2004 to 1/2007

Providing design automation research and support to company wide
product groups developing implantable medical devices.  Areas of
expertise include front-end IC design, formal verification,
system modeling, and behavioral logic synthesis.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Leading behavioral synthesis initiative to automatically
  compile system models to FPGA and ASIC implementations.
  * Developed the Atom language and compiler to generate Verilog
    from object-oriented system models.
  * Conducting feasibility study of the migration of firmware to
    Atom to reduce the need for centralized processors in
    implantable devices, potentially saving power and lowering
    verification effort.

* Leading initiatives in formal verification.
  * Using model checking, verified system requirements for bus
    arbitration and DSP power consumption on Medtronic's next
    generation cardiac therapy.
  * Instructed several courses at Medtronic on model checking
    for hardware and firmware verification.

* Support of all digital IC design and verification tools
  including system modeling, digital simulation, model checking,
  ASIC synthesis, FPGA synthesis, and equivalence checking.


LAUNCHBIRD DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.  
Eden Prairie, MN  
President and Founder
5/2002 to 1/2004
  
Launchbird developed tools and languages for digital logic and
embedded real-time software design.  Responsibilities included
all business operations ranging across product development,
marketing, and customer support.  
  
Key Accomplishments:  

* Design of the Confluence language and compiler, and
  demonstrated applications in DSP, microprocessor design,
  forward error correction coding, and reconfigurable computing.

* On invitation by Intel, presented Confluence at the 2005
  conference on Function Programming for Hardware Description
  Languages.
  
  
DILLON ENGINEERING, INC.  
Edina, MN  
http://www.dilloneng.com/  
Project Engineer Associate  
5/2000 to 5/2002  
  
Consulting firm designs real-time embedded systems for image
processing, DSP, networking, and control applications for
clients in commercial and military sectors.  Responsibilities
included the development and verification of the DSP IP core
libraries, and the design lead for several control, networking,
and vision system projects.
  
Key Accomplishments:  

* Created the ParaCore framework for VHDL code generation to
  increase productivity and design assurance.
  
* Using ParaCore, designed a parametric FFT IP core for a
  vision system.  When synthesized to Xilinx Virtex-II, it was
  at the time, the world's fastest FFT implementation.

  
HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL, INC.  
Glendale, AZ  
Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCS)  
Systems Engineer  
6/1998 to 5/2000  
  
Performed automatic flight control system development for 
high-end business aircraft.  Followed DO-178B software 
development practices including requirements definition and
validation, system design, safety analysis, integration, and
system verification.  
  
Key Accomplishments:  
  
* Designed Raytheon's Hawker Horizon yaw damper control laws
  based on linear and non-linear aircraft models using modern
  techniques including robustness analysis and neural-network
  gain scheduling.

* Assisted in developing the Honeywell Autocode Manager (HAM)
  Simulink block-set for the Primus Epic integrated modular
  avionics platform.
  
* Conducted auto-throttle bench, integration, and flight  
  testing for Bombardier's Global Express.
