EATON CORPORATION
Eden Prairie, MN
http://www.eaton.com/
Lead Embedded Software Engineer
10/2007 to Present

Leading software development activities for Eaton's hydraulic
hybrid vehicle programs.  Establishing and maintaining advance
design automation tools and tool-chains including the application
of code generation and formal verification.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Developed the core software architecture for two successful
  hybrid vehicle programs, one of which is in production.

* Created the ImProve compiler and verification tool for high
  assurance embedded software.  ImProve performs k-induction,
  SMT based model checking to verify safety properties.  Used
  in the verification of Eaton's hybrid vehicle control systems.

* Created Atom, a Haskell DSL providing lock-free, concurrent
  programming with deterministic time and memory performance.
  Atom synthesizes task scheduling at compile-time, reducing
  the burden of timing analysis.  Presented Atom at CUFP 2008.

* Designed a DSL to model PowerPC processors for the simulation
  and formal analysis of object code.  Used the tools to
  analyze security protocols of an embedded bootloader.

* Invented two hydraulic pumps with theoretical efficiency
  improvements over conventional axial piston pumps.


MEDTRONIC, INC.
Fridley, MN
http://www.medtronic.com/
Senior Design Automation Engineer
1/2004 to 10/2007

Providing design automation research and support to company wide
product groups developing implantable medical devices.  Areas of
expertise include front-end IC design, formal verification,
system modeling, and behavioral logic synthesis.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Leading behavioral synthesis initiative to automatically
  compile system models to FPGA and ASIC implementations.

  * Developed the Atom language and compiler to generate Verilog
    from object-oriented system models.

  * Conducting feasibility study of the migration of firmware to
    Atom to reduce the need for centralized processors in
    implantable devices, potentially saving power and lowering
    verification effort.

* Leading initiatives in formal verification.

  * Using model checking, verified system requirements for bus
    arbitration and DSP power consumption on Medtronic's next
    generation cardiac therapy.

  * Instructed several courses at Medtronic on model checking
    for hardware and firmware verification.

* Support of all digital IC design and verification tools
  including system modeling, digital simulation, model checking,
  ASIC synthesis, FPGA synthesis, and equivalence checking.


LAUNCHBIRD DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.  
Eden Prairie, MN  
President and Founder
5/2002 to 1/2004
  
Key Accomplishments:  

* Design of the Confluence language and compiler, and
  demonstrated applications in DSP, microprocessor design,
  forward error correction coding, and reconfigurable computing.

* On invitation by Intel, presented Confluence at the 2005
  conference on Function Programming for Hardware Description
  Languages.
  
  
DILLON ENGINEERING, INC.  
Edina, MN  
http://www.dilloneng.com/  
Project Engineer Associate  
5/2000 to 5/2002  
  
Consulting firm designs real-time embedded systems for image
processing, DSP, networking, and control applications for
clients in commercial and military sectors.
  
Key Accomplishments:  

* Created the ParaCore framework for VHDL code generation to
  increase productivity and design assurance.
  
* Using ParaCore, designed a parametric FFT IP core for a
  vision system.  When synthesized to Xilinx Virtex-II, it was
  at the time, the world's fastest known FFT implementation.

  
HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL, INC.  
Glendale, AZ  
Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCS)  
Systems Engineer  
6/1998 to 5/2000  
  
Performed automatic flight control system development for 
high-end business aircraft.  Followed DO-178B software 
development practices including requirements definition and
validation, system design, safety analysis, integration, and
system verification.  
  
Key Accomplishments:  
  
* Designed Raytheon's Hawker Horizon yaw damper control laws
  based on linear and non-linear aircraft models using modern
  techniques including robustness analysis and neural-network
  gain scheduling.

* Conducted auto-throttle bench, integration, and flight  
  testing for Bombardier's Global Express.
