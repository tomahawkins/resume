BAE Systems
Burlington, MA
http://www.baesystems.com/
Principle Software Engineer
11/2011 to Present

Working with the DARPA CRASH SAFE team, which includes
researchers from BAE Systems, University of Pennsylvania,
Northeastern University, and Harvard University, to develop a
new processor, new programming languages, and a new operating
system with information flow control (IFC) enforced at every
layer in the stack.  Responsible for the overall development of
the SAFE toolchain and closely supporting FPGA design, language
development, compiler construction, and network implementations.

Key Accomplishments:

* Created the SAFE assembler, including embedding the SAFE
  machine language into a Haskell DSL.  Initiated the migration
  of the entire SAFE toolchain to Haskell.

* Created CIRC: a Haskell library for describing fine-grained
  bidirectional compiler flows.  CIRC takes Nanopass-like
  descriptions and generates compiler IRs and transformations in
  Haskell.
  
* Using CIRC, built the first Breeze compiler and demonstrated
  end-to-end compilation with execution on the SAFE instruction
  set simulator.  (Breeze is a high-order functional language
  with IFC semantics for SAFE application programming.)

* Using SMT, verified IFC noninterference security properties of
  abstract representations of the SAFE processor, supplanting
  methods of randomized testing introduced to support Coq
  verification.

* Built an Ethernet implementation in Bluespec for the SAFE
  processor and demonstrated the design on the FPGA.

* Presented an overview of the SAFE project at CUFP 2013,
  emphasizing the use of embedded Haskell DSLs in the toolchain:

EATON CORPORATION
Eden Prairie, MN
http://www.eaton.com/
Lead Embedded Software Engineer
10/2007 to 11/2011

Lead embedded software development for Eaton's parallel
hydraulic hybrid vehicles.  Created the software architecture
for the HLA family of vehicles and guided development from
prototype to production.  Established advance design tools and
promoted the use of code generation and formal methods.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Successfully led the development of HLA embedded software to
  production.  Involved in all aspects of program including
  control law design, supervisory state machines, fault
  monitoring and diagnostics, intra-vehicle J1939 networking,
  data logging, cellular telemetry and remote fleet management.

* Created the ImProve DSL for the design and verification of
  high assurance embedded software.  ImProve performs formal
  verification of safety properties using SMT model checking.
  With ImProve we were able to find several undiscovered
  specification defects and was able to prove the existence
  of a known software bug that previously destroyed $80K of
  pump hardware.

* Created Atom, a Haskell DSL providing lock-free, concurrent
  programming with deterministic time and memory performance.
  Atom synthesizes task scheduling at compile-time, reducing
  the burden of WCET analysis and the need for an RTOS.
  Presented Atom at CUFP 2008.

* Created a fault tree analysis tool that uses SMT to calculate
  minimal cut sets.  Applied the tool in HLA safety analysis.

* Invented three hydraulic pumps with theoretical mechanical and
  efficiency improvements over conventional axial piston pumps.
  Using functional programming, designed tools to model and
  visualize pump kinematics and derive optimal cam profiles.


MEDTRONIC, INC.
Fridley, MN
http://www.medtronic.com/
Senior Design Automation Engineer
1/2004 to 10/2007

Providing design automation research and support to company wide
product groups developing implantable medical devices.  Areas of
expertise include front-end IC design, formal verification,
system modeling, and behavioral logic synthesis.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Leading behavioral synthesis initiative to automatically
  compile system models to FPGA and ASIC implementations.

  * Developed the Atom DSL and compiler to generate Verilog
    from object-oriented behavioral models.

  * Conducting feasibility study of the migration of firmware to
    Atom to reduce the need for centralized processors in
    implantable devices, potentially saving power and lowering
    verification effort.

* Leading initiatives in formal verification.

  * Using model checking, verified system requirements for bus
    arbitration and DSP power consumption on Medtronic's next
    generation cardiac therapy.

  * Instructed several courses at Medtronic on model checking
    for hardware and firmware verification.

* Supported all frontend digital design and verification tools
  including system modeling, digital simulation, model checking,
  ASIC synthesis, FPGA synthesis, and formal equivalence
  checking.  Integrated with backend flows including timing
  closure, DFT, physical design, and LVS/DRC.
