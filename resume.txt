BAE Systems, Inc.
Burlington, MA
http://www.baesystems.com/
Principle Software Engineer
11/2011 to Present

Research and software engineering in support of various DARPA
programs including CRASH (computer information flow control),
PERFECT (low power, fault tolerant hardware), and HACMS
(embedded computer security).  On projects partnered closely
with programming language, compiler, and hardware researchers
from the University of Pennsylvania, Northeastern University,
Harvard University, and Princeton University.

Key Accomplishments:

* Using Haskell and ACL2, built two independent proof frameworks
  for the Ivory-Haskell DSL (HACMS).  One compiles Ivory
  procedures to ACL2 for formal modeling, the second performs
  interprocedural analysis to verify user specified and compiler
  generated assertions and procedure contracts.

* Developed the CRASH-SAFE assembly DSL (embedded in Haskell)
  and the assembler for the SAFE processor.

* Created the Haskell CIRC library for describing fine-grained
  bidirectional compiler flows.  CIRC takes Nanopass-like
  descriptions and generates compiler IR datatypes and
  transformations in Haskell.  Using CIRC, built the first Breeze
  compiler and demonstrated end-to-end compilation with execution
  on the SAFE instruction set simulator.  (Breeze is a high-order
  functional language with IFC semantics for SAFE application
  programming.)

* Using SMT, verified noninterference security properties of
  abstract representations of the SAFE processor, augmenting
  methods of randomized testing introduced to support formal
  verification in Coq.

* Built an Ethernet stack in Bluespec for the SAFE processor and
  demonstrated the design on the FPGA.

* Presented an overview of SAFE at CUFP 2013, emphasizing
  the use of embedded Haskell DSLs in the toolchain:

EATON CORPORATION
Eden Prairie, MN
http://www.eaton.com/
Lead Embedded Software Engineer
10/2007 to 11/2011

Led embedded software development for Eaton's parallel
hydraulic hybrid vehicles.  Created the software architecture
for the HLA family of vehicles and guided development from
prototype to production.  Established advanced design tools
and promoted the use of code generation and formal methods.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Successfully led the development of HLA embedded software to
  production.  Involved in all aspects of program including
  control law design, supervisory state machines, fault
  monitoring and diagnostics, intra-vehicle J1939 networking,
  data logging, cellular telemetry, and remote fleet management.

* Created the ImProve DSL and used it to design and verify
  critical aspects of HLA software.  ImProve performs formal
  verification of safety properties using SMT model checking.
  With it we were able to find several undiscovered
  specification and design defects and it was able to show the
  existence of a known software bug that previously destroyed
  $80K worth of hydraulic pump hardware.

* Created Atom, a Haskell DSL providing lock-free, concurrent
  programming with deterministic time and memory performance.
  Atom synthesizes task scheduling at compile-time, reducing
  the burden of WCET analysis and the need for an RTOS.
  Presented Atom at CUFP 2008.

* Created a fault tree analysis tool that uses SMT to calculate
  minimal cut sets.  Applied the tool in HLA safety analysis.

* Invented three hydraulic pumps with theoretical efficiency
  improvements over conventional axial piston pumps.  Used
  functional programming to model and visualize pump kinematics
  and to derive optimal cam profiles.


MEDTRONIC, INC.
Fridley, MN
http://www.medtronic.com/
Senior Design Automation Engineer
1/2004 to 10/2007

Providing design automation research and support to company wide
product groups developing implantable medical devices.  Areas of
expertise include front-end IC design, formal verification,
system modeling, and behavioral logic synthesis.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Leading behavioral synthesis initiative to automatically
  compile system models to FPGA and ASIC implementations.

  * Developed the Atom DSL and compiler to generate Verilog
    from object-oriented behavioral models.

  * Conducting feasibility study of the migration of firmware to
    Atom to reduce the need for centralized processors in
    implantable devices, potentially saving power and lowering
    verification effort.

* Leading initiatives in formal verification.

  * Using model checking, verified system requirements for bus
    arbitration and DSP power consumption on Medtronic's next
    generation cardiac therapy.

  * Instructed several courses at Medtronic on model checking
    for hardware and firmware verification.

* Supported all frontend digital design and verification tools
  including system modeling, digital simulation, model checking,
  ASIC synthesis, FPGA synthesis, and formal equivalence
  checking.  Integrated with backend flows including timing
  closure, DFT, physical design, and LVS/DRC.
