EATON CORPORATION
Eden Prairie, MN
http://www.eaton.com/
Lead Embedded Software Engineer
10/2007 to Present

Leading embedded software development for Eaton's parallel
hydraulic hybrid vehicles.  Created the software architecture
for the HLA family of vehicles and guided development from
prototype to production.  Established advance design tools and
promoted the use of code generation and formal methods.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Successfully led the development of HLA embedded software to
  production.  Involved in all aspects of program including
  control law design, supervisory state machines, fault
  monitoring and diagnostics, intra-vehicle J1939 networking,
  data logging, cellular telemetry and remote fleet management.

* Created the ImProve DSL for the design and verification of
  high assurance embedded software.  ImProve performs formal
  verification of safety properties using SMT model checking.
  ImProve is used in the design of Eaton's HLA hybrid vehicle.

* Created Atom, a Haskell DSL providing lock-free, concurrent
  programming with deterministic time and memory performance.
  Atom synthesizes task scheduling at compile-time, reducing
  the burden of WCET analysis and the need for an RTOS.
  Presented Atom at CUFP 2008.

* Created a fault tree analysis tool that uses SMT to calculate
  minimal cut sets.  Applied the tool in the safety analysis of 
  HLA Bus.

* Invented three hydraulic pumps with theoretical mechanical and
  efficiency improvements over conventional axial piston pumps.
  Using functional programming, designed tools to model and
  visualize pump kinematics and derive optimal cam profiles.


MEDTRONIC, INC.
Fridley, MN
http://www.medtronic.com/
Senior Design Automation Engineer
1/2004 to 10/2007

Providing design automation research and support to company wide
product groups developing implantable medical devices.  Areas of
expertise include front-end IC design, formal verification,
system modeling, and behavioral logic synthesis.

Key Accomplishments:  

* Leading behavioral synthesis initiative to automatically
  compile system models to FPGA and ASIC implementations.

  * Developed the Atom DSL and compiler to generate Verilog
    from object-oriented behavioral models.

  * Conducting feasibility study of the migration of firmware to
    Atom to reduce the need for centralized processors in
    implantable devices, potentially saving power and lowering
    verification effort.

* Leading initiatives in formal verification.

  * Using model checking, verified system requirements for bus
    arbitration and DSP power consumption on Medtronic's next
    generation cardiac therapy.

  * Instructed several courses at Medtronic on model checking
    for hardware and firmware verification.

* Support of all digital IC design and verification tools
  including system modeling, digital simulation, model checking,
  ASIC synthesis, FPGA synthesis, and equivalence checking.


LAUNCHBIRD DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC.  
Eden Prairie, MN  
President and Founder
5/2002 to 1/2004

Started a company to develop and promote Confluence: a
functional programming language for ASIC and FPGA design.
  
Key Accomplishments:  

* Design of the Confluence language and compiler, and
  demonstrated applications in DSP, microprocessor design,
  forward error correction coding, and reconfigurable computing.

* On invitation by Intel, presented Confluence at the 2005
  conference on Function Programming for Hardware Description
  Languages.
  
  
DILLON ENGINEERING, INC.  
Edina, MN  
http://www.dilloneng.com/  
Project Engineer Associate  
5/2000 to 5/2002  
  
Consulting firm designs FPGA systems for image processing,
computer vision, DSP, networking, and control applications
for clients in commercial and military sectors.
  
Key Accomplishments:  

* Created the ParaCore framework for VHDL code generation to
  increase productivity and design assurance.
  
* Using ParaCore, designed a parametric FFT IP core for a
  vision system.  When synthesized to Xilinx Virtex-II, it was
  at the time, the world's fastest known FFT implementation.

  
HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL, INC.  
Glendale, AZ  
Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCS)  
Systems Engineer  
6/1998 to 5/2000  
  
Performed automatic flight control system development for 
high-end business aircraft.  Followed DO-178B software 
development practices including requirements definition and
validation, system design, safety analysis, integration, and
system verification.  
  
Key Accomplishments:  
  
* Designed Raytheon's Hawker Horizon yaw damper control laws
  based on linear and non-linear aircraft models using modern
  techniques including robustness analysis and neural-network
  gain scheduling.

* Conducted auto-throttle bench, integration, and flight  
  testing for Bombardier's Global Express.
