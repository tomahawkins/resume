Hello,

I am submitting my resume for consideration for the Engineer Principal position (req# 00046308).

Most of my experience has centered on embedded system development, with emphasis on real-time
control and design automation.  As a member of the automatic flight control systems group,
Honeywell gave me exposure to complex aircraft systems, Simulink model-driven development, and
conforming to the safety critical software standards of DO-178b.  At Dillon Engineering, I had
opportunities to design several processor and FPGA based systems, work directly with external
customers to establish system requirements, and create design tools to aid the system
development process.  Based on these experiences, I started Launchbird Design Systems, Inc. to
develop, market, and sell design automation tools for hardware and real-time embedded systems.  I am
currently employed by Medtronic working for the CAD group developing and supporting tools for
hardware and firmware designers throughout the medical device company.

I tend to work best in a research oriented environment where, as part of a team, I can explore,
develop, and promote emerging technologies.  The job description for the
Platforms and Software group aligns well with my current interests, which include
safety critical control networks (FlexRay), fault management synthesis,
reactive system description languages, and tools for cooperative large-scale
system integration.

Though I only have a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering,
I have been recognized by Intel's Strategic CAD Labs for my work on the
Confluence embedded systems language, and I currently leading
Medtronic's efforts in hardware and firmware formal verification.

Please contact me to schedule an interview, and thank you for the consideration.

Sincerely,

Tom Hawkins
